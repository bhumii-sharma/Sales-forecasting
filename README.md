# Sales Forecasting Project üöÄ  

This repository contains a comprehensive project on **sales forecasting**, designed to help businesses accurately estimate future sales volumes. Leveraging both traditional and machine learning techniques, the project aims to address key challenges and provide actionable insights for strategic decision-making.  

## üìÇ Project Structure  
1. **Data**  
   - Datasets featuring historical sales, economic indicators, and external factors like promotions and seasonal effects.  

2. **Notebooks**  
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, seasonality, and cyclical patterns.  
   - Model development and validation steps.  

3. **Scripts**  
   - Automated scripts for preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.  

4. **Models**  
   - Pre-trained forecasting models optimized for accuracy and scalability.  

5. **Documentation**  
   - Comprehensive documentation of techniques, evaluation metrics, and model explanations.  

6. **Deployment**  
   - Tools for real-time forecasting and integration with business systems.  

## üìä Key Features  
- **Forecasting Methods**:  
  - Time Series Models: ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing.  
  - Machine Learning Models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.  
  - Hybrid Approaches: Combining traditional and machine learning models.  

- **Advanced Features**:  
  - Feature Engineering: Incorporates seasonality, promotions, and economic indicators.  
  - Scenario Analysis: Prepares for various future market conditions.  
  - Automation: Real-time updates for dynamic sales environments.  

- **Evaluation and Metrics**:  
  - Accuracy Metrics: MAE, MSE, and MAPE to validate model predictions.  
  - Cross-validation and error analysis for robust performance.
